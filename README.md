## Ideas box
- Multiplayer (vs/coop)

- Basic story

## Gameplay
The main gameplay will revolve around operating a trading company.
### Game Loop
#### Early game
You start as the captain of a clipper ship with the choice of starting on any of several ports:
- Hong Kong (British, 1842)
- Batvia (Dutch, 1600s)
- Manila (Spain, later US in 1869)
- Saigon (French)
- Singapore (British)

Initially you can make money buying and selling at different ports. These ports include all starting locations as well as:
- Shanghai, CN
- Nagasaki, JP
- Edo, JP (Became Tokyo in 1868)
- Canton, CN (European name)
- ?maybe? Tianjin, CN
- Calcutta, IN (Under british control, old name)
#### Mid Game
Once you build up enough money you can begin to get involved in western trade routes. In game this operates as hiring a 3rd party to transport goods. This is risky as you only have outdated prices, but the western prices are nearly always higher than nearby ports. these ports include;
- London, England
- Amsterdam, Dutch Republic
- Le Havre, France
- Antwerp, Belgium
- San Fransisco, US (After 1860)
#### Late Game
TODO: figure out what would be interesting to do when you are this rich. Ideas:
- Influence market to make money
- Nothing just keep existing gameplay
### Game elements
